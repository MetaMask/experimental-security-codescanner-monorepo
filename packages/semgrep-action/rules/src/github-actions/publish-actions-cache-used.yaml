      shortDescription: Potential cache poisoning risk by using `actions/cache` in a publishing workflow.
      confidence: MEDIUM
      help: |
        ## Remediation
        We recommend avoiding using `actions/cache` if this workflow publishes a release or has access to sensitive secrets. 
        If caching is required, please see https://github.com/MetaMask/MetaMask-planning/issues/3925 for a workaround.
